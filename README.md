# Examples of my code style

Often, employers want to know my code examples.  Here are some of them.

## aws_report.bash
Mostrous AWS report which dumps multiple spreadsheets.

## backup_report_linux.pl
An example of perl.  I had to take a data dump of the Netbackup status, and create a report sorted by service type that was parsed and used with our scripts.  I know, I know.  Nobody uses perl anymore.  I am sure this wouldn't run now, but it was the bee's knees when I needed to send customers reports on how much backup space they were taking up 9and could be billed overages).

## backup_report_by_service.pl
An example of perl.  I had to take a data dump of the Netbackup status via a Windows box, and create a report sorted by service type.  Similar to above.

## check_drive_encryption.py
Checks my AWS EC2 instances to see if the drive is encrypted or not.  This was part of our HIPAA compliance.

## ru_up.py
Checks to see what instances are up, and if it can't ssh into them, throw a reason why.  We did this after monthly
maintenance

## vmware-netfix.bash: 
A while ago, I worked for a company that had VMWare images that needed to set themselves on the proper network, and identify themselves with banners, settings, and so on based on their network identity.  This is a bash program I am proud of, even if by now, it's a little outdated as far as need.
