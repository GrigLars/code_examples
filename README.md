# Examples of my code style

Often, employers want to know my code examples.  Here are some of them.

## vmware-netfix: 
A while ago, I worked for a company that had VMWare images that needed to set themselves on the proper network, and identify themselves with banners, settings, and so on based on their network identity.  This is a bash program I am proud of, evcen if by now, it's a little outdated as far as need.

## backup_report_by_service.pl
An example of perl.  I had to take a data dump of the Netbackup status via a widows box, and create a report sorted by service type.
